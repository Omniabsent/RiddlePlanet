	<h1>TESS</h1> 
      <p>Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is a space telescope for NASA's Explorer program, designed to search for exoplanets using the transit method in an area 400 times larger than that covered by the Kepler mission. It was launched on 18 April 2018, atop a Falcon 9 launch vehicle and was placed into a highly elliptical 13.70-day orbit around the Earth. The first light image from TESS was taken on 7 August 2018, and released publicly on 17 September 2018. </p>

	  <h1>NEXT CHALLENGE:</h1>
      <p>Surprisingly, not every exoplanet is orbiting a solar system. Some are lonely dashing through space without any stars to call their own. How are those called?</p>
