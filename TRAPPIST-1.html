	<h1>TRAPPIST-1</h1> 
      <p>TRAPPIST-1 is orbited by seven planets, designated TRAPPIST-1b, 1c, 1d, 1e, 1f, 1g, and 1h[82] in alphabetic order going out from the star. These planets have orbital periods ranging from 1.5 to 19 days, at distances of 0.011–0.059 astronomical units[u] (1,700,000–8,900,000 km). All the planets are much closer to their star than Mercury is to the Sun, making the TRAPPIST-1 system very compact. </p>
	  <p>Up to four of the planets – designated d, e, f and g – orbit at distances where temperatures are suitable for the existence of liquid water, and are thus potentially hospitable to life. There is no evidence of an atmosphere on any of the planets, and observations of TRAPPIST-1 b have ruled out the existence of an atmosphere. It is unclear whether radiation emissions from TRAPPIST-1 would allow for such atmospheres. The planets have low densities; they may consist of large amounts of volatile materials. Due to the possibility of several of the planets being habitable, the system has drawn interest from researchers and has appeared in popular culture. </p>

	  <h1>FINAL CHALLENGE:</h1>
      <p>Although yet to be confirmed, due to how hard they are to detect, the existence of natural satellites orbiting exoplanets is likely. Now that you've come this far, the name for such objects should be pretty easy to guess. </p>
