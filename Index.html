	<h1>Welcome to riddleplanet!</h1> 
      <p>A riddle was a game format popular in the early 2000s where you have to guess the url of the next page based on a hint from the current one. <br> Put your google skills to the test and learn more about exoplanets by following the trail of pages. <br> If you get it wrong at first, you can come back and try again as many times as needed. Some answers can have more than one word so the url will have spaces on it.<br> Begin your journey by replacing the /index in the url above with /exoplanet and pressing enter to get to the next page.</p>
