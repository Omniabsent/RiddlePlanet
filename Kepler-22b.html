	<h1>KEPLER-22B</h1> 
      <p>Kepler-22b (also known by its Kepler Object of Interest designation KOI-087.01) is an exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone of the Sun-like star Kepler-22. It is located about 640 light-years (200 parsecs) from Earth in the constellation of Cygnus. It was discovered by NASA's Kepler Space Telescope in December 2011 and was the first known transiting planet to orbit within the habitable zone of a Sun-like star, where liquid water could exist on the planet's surface.</p>

	  <h1>NEXT CHALLENGE:</h1>
      <p>While CHEOPS studies the exoplanets that we already found, there are different satelites dedicated to finding new ones. While this was the job of Kepler until it was retired in 2018, there's a new tellescope who has taken its place. Which one is it?</p>
