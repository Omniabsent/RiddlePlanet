# RiddlePlanet
<p>This entire project, from initial conception and research to final deployment, was made in less than 24h by JÃºlia Lopes as a NASA SpaceApps Hackaton Challenge.</p>
<p>My aim was not only to teach about exoplanets, but also bring back the memory of a long-lost game format I grew up with, while also promoting the habit of research, persistence, and basic computer literacy in the age of smartphones.</p>
<p>Images utilized are from www.science.nasa.gov and www.space.com</p>
<p>Some texts are from wikipedia, others are written by myself.</p>
<p>A heartfelt thanks to team hosting the event for the opportunity and to the beta testers for the feedback.</p>
